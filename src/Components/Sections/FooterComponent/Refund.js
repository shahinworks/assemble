  FAQs. General Information
How long will my order take to ship?
We usually ship them within 24-48 hours.
In case any product says Out Of Stock or Pre-Order, it means the product is in manufacturing and will arrive within 2-
3 weeks. We notify you and manage your waiting list on a first-come-first-served basis.
On rare occasions, a specific size/color combination may not be available right away. In that case, kindly allow up
to 10 days to refill our T-shirt inventory before you can place your order.
My payment was successful but the order status shows Pending Payment/Failed. Why?
You may have experienced an error/glitch on the payment gateway page or technical difficulties due to which our
website couldn't capture your transaction (even though it's successful).
In this case, we request you to contact us via email-operations@theveshticompany.com. We will resolve this by
manually processing your order.
Why are a few of the products out of stock?
Our product designs are in the experimental phase now, so we have them on our website as a showcase of our
collections. We also have the fast selling products that we keep re-stocking that are available on the website.

However, we do restock the out-of-stock products at different intervals and hence we have them on showcase to help
our customers understand the collection we have.
We request you to follow our social media for updates when the out of stock products will be available once again.
