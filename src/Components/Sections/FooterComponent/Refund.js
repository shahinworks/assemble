        <p className='text-left mx-5'> In case any product says Out Of Stock or Pre-Order, it means the product is in manufacturing and will arrive within 2-
          3 weeks. We notify you and manage your waiting list on a first-come-first-served basis.</p>
        <p className='text-left mx-5'>On rare occasions, a specific size/color combination may not be available right away. In that case, kindly allow up

        collections. We also have the fast selling products that we keep re-stocking that are available on the website.</p>
        <p className='text-left mx-5'>
        However, we do restock the out-of-stock products at different intervals and hence we have them on showcase to help
        our customers understand the collection we have.</p>
        <p className='text-left mx-5'> We request you to follow our social media for updates when the out of stock products will be available once again.
